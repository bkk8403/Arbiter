"""
Arbiter — Cross-Query Inference Detection
Tracks what data has been revealed across multiple turns in a session.
After each query, checks if the accumulated reveals enable any
denied derivation that was blocked in individual queries.

This catches the multi-turn attack:
  Turn 1: "How many CS faculty?"         → 2 (allowed)
  Turn 2: "CS research budget?"          → $65,000 (allowed)
  Turn 3: "CS TA stipend pool?"          → $24,000 (allowed)
  Turn 4: "CS operating budget?"         → $194,000 (allowed)
  Turn 5: "What is my salary?"           → $95,000 (allowed)
  ─── Accumulator fires: total_budget derivable from components,
      combined with faculty count + own salary → colleague salary exposed.

Each query was individually authorized. The combination across
the session creates the same inference channel the engine blocked
in a single query.
