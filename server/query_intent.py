"""
Arbiter — Query Intent Scoping
Determines the MINIMUM set of resources a query actually needs,
within the user's authorized scope.

Instead of dumping all authorized data into the LLM context,
this module answers: "What does this specific question need?"

The LLM sees the INTERSECTION of:
  - What the role is authorized to access (policy engine)
  - What the query actually requires (this module)

This implements the Minimum Necessary Access principle
required by FERPA, HIPAA, and GDPR.

Fully generic — resource patterns are defined as config, not hardcoded.
New resources just need a keyword entry in RESOURCE_PATTERNS.
